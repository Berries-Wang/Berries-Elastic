# Date Math
Most parameters which accept a formatted date value — such as gt and lt in range queries, or from and to in daterange aggregations — understand date maths.

The expression starts with an anchor date, which can either be now, or a date string ending with ||. This anchor date can optionally be followed by one or more maths expressions:(表达式以锚日期开头，锚日期可以是now，也可以是以||结尾的日期字符串。此锚定日期后可以选择一个或多个数学表达式：)
+ +1h: Add one hour
+ -1d: Subtract one day
+ /d: Round down to the nearest day

The supported time units differ from those supported by time units for durations. The supported units are:
| 字符 | 含义    |
|------|---------|
| y    | Years   |
| M    | Months  |
| w    | Weeks   |
| d    | Days    |
| h    | Hours   |
| H    | Hours   |
| m    | Minutes |
| s    | Seconds |

Assuming now is 2001-01-01 12:00:00, some examples are:
|表达式|含义|
|---|---|
|now+1h|now in milliseconds plus one hour. Resolves to: 2001-01-01 13:00:00|
|now-1h|now in milliseconds minus one hour. Resolves to: 2001-01-01 11:00:00|
|now-1h/d|now in milliseconds minus one hour, rounded down to UTC 00:00. Resolves to: 2001-01-01 00:00:00|
|2001.02.01\\\|\\\|+1M/d|2001-02-01 in milliseconds plus one month. Resolves to: 2001-03-01 00:00:00|
