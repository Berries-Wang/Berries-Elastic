# rewrite parameter
Elasticsearch uses Apache Lucene internally to power indexing and searching. In their original form, Lucene cannot execute the following queries:（Elasticsearch在内部使用Apache Lucene来支持索引和搜索。在原始形式下，Lucene无法执行以下查询：）
+ fuzzy
+ prefix
+ query_string
+ regexp
+ wildcard

To execute them, Lucene changes these queries to a simpler form, such as a bool query or a bit set.

The rewrite parameter determines:（rewrite参数决定）
1. How Lucene calculates the relevance scores for each matching document
2. Whether Lucene changes the original query to a bool query or bit set
3. If changed to a bool query, which term query clauses are included

## Valid values
- constant_score_blended (Default)
  + Assigns each document a relevance score equal to the boost parameter.
  + This method maintains a bool query like implementation over the most costly terms while pre-processing the less costly terms into a filter bitset.（此方法在最昂贵的术语上保持类似bool查询的实现，同时将成本较低的术语预处理到过滤器位集中。）
  + This method can cause the generated bool query to exceed the clause limit in the indices.query.bool.max_clause_count setting. If the query exceeds this limit, Elasticsearch returns an error.

- constant_score
  + Uses the constant_score_boolean method for fewer matching terms. Otherwise, this method finds all matching terms in sequence and returns matching documents using a bit set.（使用constant_score_boolean方法来减少匹配项。否则，此方法将按顺序查找所有匹配的术语，并使用位集返回匹配的文档。）

- constant_score_boolean
  + Assigns each document a relevance score equal to the boost parameter.
  + This method changes the original query to a bool query. This bool query contains a should clause and term query for each matching term.
  + This method can cause the final bool query to exceed the clause limit in the indices.query.bool.max_clause_count setting. If the query exceeds this limit, Elasticsearch returns an error.

- scoring_boolean
  + Calculates a relevance score for each matching document.
  + This method changes the original query to a bool query. This bool query contains a should clause and term query for each matching term.
  + This method can cause the final bool query to exceed the clause limit in the indices.query.bool.max_clause_count setting. If the query exceeds this limit, Elasticsearch returns an error.

- top_terms_blended_freqs_N
  - Calculates a relevance score for each matching document as if all terms had the same frequency. This frequency is the maximum frequency of all matching terms.
  - This method changes the original query to a bool query. This bool query contains a should clause and term query for each matching term.
  - The final bool query only includes term queries for the top N scoring terms.
  - You can use this method to avoid exceeding the clause limit in the indices.query.bool.max_clause_count setting.

- top_terms_boost_N
  - Assigns each matching document a relevance score equal to the boost parameter.
  - This method changes the original query to a bool query. This bool query contains a should clause and term query for each matching term.
  - The final bool query only includes term queries for the top N terms.
  - You can use this method to avoid exceeding the clause limit in the indices.query.bool.max_clause_count setting.

- top_terms_N
  - Calculates a relevance score for each matching document.
  - This method changes the original query to a bool query. This bool query contains a should clause and term query for each matching term.
  - The final bool query only includes term queries for the top N scoring terms.
  - You can use this method to avoid exceeding the clause limit in the indices.query.bool.max_clause_count setting.
