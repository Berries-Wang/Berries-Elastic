# Multi-match query
The multi_match query builds on the [match query](./000.Match%20Query.md) to allow multi-field queries:
> 即 将多种类型的match查询通过某个查询语法联合在一起，单个multi-match可拆分为单个或多个不同类型的查询


```txt
    GET /_search
    {
      "query": {
        "multi_match" : {
          "query":    "this is a test",   #1: the query string
          "fields": [ "subject", "message" ] #2: the fields to be queried
        }
      }
    }
```

## fields and per-field boosting
Fields can be specified with wildcards, eg:(字段可以用通配符指定，例如：)
```txt
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query":    "Will Smith", 
      "fields": [ "title", "*_name" ] #1: Query the title , first_name and last_name fields
    }
  }
}
```

Individual fields can be boosted with the caret (^) notation:(可以使用插入符号（^）增强单个字段：)
```txt
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query" : "this is a test",
      "fields" : [ "subject^3", "message" ] #1:The query multiplies the subject field’s score by three but leaves the message field’s score unchanged.(查询将主题字段的得分乘以3，但消息字段的得分保持不变。)
    }
  }
}
```
If no fields are provided, the multi_match query defaults to the index.query.default_field index settings, which in turn defaults to *. * extracts all fields in the mapping that are eligible to term queries and filters the metadata fields. All extracted fields are then combined to build a query.(如果没有提供字段，则multi_match查询默认为index.query.default_field索引设置，而该设置又默认为\*\.\*提取映射中符合术语查询条件的所有字段，并过滤元数据字段。然后将所有提取的字段组合在一起以构建查询。)

## Types of multi_match query:
The way the multi_match query is executed internally depends on the type parameter, which can be set to:(multi_match查询在内部执行的方式取决于类型参数，该参数可以设置为：)
+ best_fields
  - Finds documents which match any field, but uses the _score from the best field.(查找与任何字段匹配的文档，但使用最佳字段中的_score。)
+  most_fields
   - Finds documents which match any field and combines the _score from each field. See most_fields.（查找与任何字段匹配的文档，并组合每个字段的_score）
+ cross_fields
  - Treats fields with the same analyzer as though they were one big field. Looks for each word in any field. (用相同的分析器处理字段，就像它们是一个大字段一样。查找任何字段中的每个单词。)
+ phrase
  - Runs a match_phrase query on each field and uses the _score from the best field. See phrase and phrase_prefix.(对每个字段运行match_phrase查询，并使用最佳字段中的_score。)
+ phrase_prefix
  - Runs a match_phrase_prefix query on each field and uses the _score from the best field. See phrase and phrase_prefix.
+ bool_prefix
  - Creates a match_bool_prefix query on each field and combines the _score from each field. See bool_prefix.(在每个字段上创建match_bool_prefix查询，并组合每个字段的_score。请参见bool_prefix。)

### best_fields
The best_fields type is most useful when you are searching for multiple words best found in the same field. For instance “brown fox” in a single field is more meaningful than “brown” in one field and “fox” in the other.（当您在同一字段中搜索多个最佳单词时，best_fields类型最有用。例如，一个字段中的“brown fox”比一个字段的““brown”和另一个字段里的“fox”更有意义。）

The best_fields type generates a [match query](./000.Match%20Query.md) for each field and wraps them in a [dis_max](../001.Compound%20Queries/05A.Disjunction%20max%20query.md) query, to find the single best matching field. For instance, this query:（best_fields类型为每个字段生成一个匹配查询，并将其包装在dis_max查询中，以找到单个最佳匹配字段。例如，此查询：）
```txt

  GET /_search
  {
    "query": {
      "multi_match" : {
        "query":      "brown fox",
        "type":       "best_fields",
        "fields":     [ "subject", "message" ],
        "tie_breaker": 0.3
      }
    }
  }

  # would be execute as
  GET /_search
  {
    "query": {
      "dis_max": {
        "queries": [
          { "match": { "subject": "brown fox" }},
          { "match": { "message": "brown fox" }}
        ],
        "tie_breaker": 0.3
      }
    }
  }
```

Normally the best_fields type uses the score of the single best matching field, but if tie_breaker is specified, then it calculates the score as follows:(通常，best_fields类型使用单个最佳匹配字段的分数，但如果指定了tie_breaker，则它会按如下方式计算分数：)
   - the score from the best matching field
   - plus tie_breaker * _score for all other matching fields

Also, accepts analyzer, boost, operator, minimum_should_match, fuzziness, lenient, prefix_length, max_expansions, fuzzy_rewrite, zero_terms_query, auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query and fuzzy_transpositions, as explained in [match query](./000.Match%20Query.md).

#### 注意事项
##### operator and minimum_should_match
The best_fields and most_fields types are field-centric — they generate a match query per field. This means that the operator and minimum_should_match parameters are applied to each field individually, which is probably not what you want.(best_fields和most_fields类型是以字段为中心的——它们为每个字段生成一个匹配查询。这意味着运算符和minimum_shold_match参数分别应用于每个字段，这可能不是您想要的。)


Take this query for example:
```txt
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query":      "Will Smith",
      "type":       "best_fields",
      "fields":     [ "first_name", "last_name" ],
      "operator":   "and"  # All terms must be present.(所有条款都必须存在。)
    }
  }
}

   # This query is executed as:
     (+first_name:will +first_name:smith)
   | (+last_name:will  +last_name:smith)
```

In other words, all terms must be present in a single field for a document to match.(换句话说，所有术语必须存在于一个字段中，文档才能匹配。)

The [combined_fields](./05A.Combined%20fields.md) query offers a term-centric approach that handles operator and minimum_should_match on a per-term basis. The other multi-match mode [cross_fields](#types-of-multi_match-query) also addresses this issue.


### most_fields
The most_fields type is most useful when querying multiple fields that contain the same text analyzed in different ways. For instance, the main field may contain synonyms, stemming and terms without diacritics. A second field may contain the original terms, and a third field might contain shingles. By combining scores from all three fields we can match as many documents as possible with the main field, but use the second and third fields to push the most similar results to the top of the list.（most_fields 类型在查询包含以不同方式分析的相同文本的多个字段时非常有用。例如，主字段可能包含同义词、词干和不带变音符号的术语。第二个字段可能包含原始术语，第三个字段可能包含 shingles。通过组合所有三个字段的分数，我们可以将尽可能多的文档与主字段匹配，但使用第二个和第三个字段将最相似的结果推到列表顶部。）
> 如下，其实也就是多个match查询
```txt
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query":      "quick brown fox",
      "type":       "most_fields",
      "fields":     [ "title", "title.original", "title.shingles" ]
    }
  }
}

# would be executed as:
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        { "match": { "title":          "quick brown fox" }},
        { "match": { "title.original": "quick brown fox" }},
        { "match": { "title.shingles": "quick brown fox" }}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
The score from each match clause is added together, just like a bool query.

Also, accepts analyzer, boost, operator, minimum_should_match, fuzziness, lenient, prefix_length, max_expansions, fuzzy_rewrite, and zero_terms_query.

### phrase and phrase_prefix
The phrase and phrase_prefix types behave just like [best_fields](#best_fields), but they use a match_phrase or match_phrase_prefix query instead of a match query.
```txt
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query":      "quick brown f",
      "type":       "phrase_prefix",
      "fields":     [ "subject", "message" ]
    }
  }
}

# would be executed as:
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "dis_max": {
      "queries": [
        { "match_phrase_prefix": { "subject": "quick brown f" }},
        { "match_phrase_prefix": { "message": "quick brown f" }}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Also, accepts analyzer, boost, lenient and zero_terms_query as explained in [Match](./000.Match%20Query.md), as well as slop which is explained in [Match phrase](./002.Match%20phrase%20query.md). Type phrase_prefix additionally accepts max_expansions.

### cross_fields
The cross_fields type is particularly useful with structured documents where multiple fields should match. For instance, when querying the first_name and last_name fields for “Will Smith”, the best match is likely to have “Will” in one field and “Smith” in the other.(cross_fields类型对于需要匹配多个字段的结构化文档特别有用。例如，在查询first_name和last_name字段中的“Will Smith”时，最佳匹配可能是一个字段中有“Will”，另一个字段有“Smith”。)
```md
   This sounds like a job for most_fields but there are two problems with that approach. The first problem is that operator and minimum_should_match are applied per-field, instead of per-term (see explanation above).
   
   The second problem is to do with relevance: the different term frequencies in the first_name and last_name fields can produce unexpected results.
   
   For instance, imagine we have two people: “Will Smith” and “Smith Jones”. “Smith” as a last name is very common (and so is of low importance) but “Smith” as a first name is very uncommon (and so is of great importance).
   
   If we do a search for “Will Smith”, the “Smith Jones” document will probably appear above the better matching “Will Smith” because the score of first_name:smith has trumped the combined scores of first_name:will plus last_name:smith.
```

One way of dealing with these types of queries is simply to index the first_name and last_name fields into a single full_name field. Of course, this can only be done at index time.(处理此类查询的一种方法是简单地将 first_name 和 last_name 字段索引到单个 full_name 字段中。当然，这只能在索引时完成。)

The cross_field type tries to solve these problems at query time by taking a term-centric approach. It first analyzes the query string into individual terms, then looks for each term in any of the fields, as though they were one big field.(cross_field类型试图通过采取以术语为中心的方法在查询时解决这些问题。它首先将查询字符串分析为单个术语，然后在任何字段中查找每个术语，就像它们是一个大字段一样。)
```txt
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query":      "Will Smith",
      "type":       "cross_fields",
      "fields":     [ "first_name", "last_name" ],
      "operator":   "and"
    }
  }
}

# is executed as
+(first_name:will last_name:will)
+(first_name:smith last_name:smith)

```

In other words, all terms must be present in at least one field for a document to match. (Compare this to the logic used for best_fields and most_fields.)

That solves one of the two problems. The problem of differing term frequencies is solved by blending the term frequencies for all fields in order to even out the differences.(这解决了两个问题中的一个。通过混合所有场的项频率以消除差异，解决了不同项频率的问题。)

In practice, first_name:smith will be treated as though it has the same frequencies as last_name:smith, plus one. This will make matches on first_name and last_name have comparable scores, with a tiny advantage for last_name since it is the most likely field that contains smith.(在实践中，first_name:smith将被视为与last_name:ssmith具有相同的频率加1。这将使first_name和last_name上的匹配具有可比的分数，last_name的优势很小，因为它是最有可能包含smith的字段。)

Note that cross_fields is usually only useful on short string fields that all have a boost of 1. Otherwise boosts, term freqs and length normalization contribute to the score in such a way that the blending of term statistics is not meaningful anymore.(请注意，cross_fields通常只对所有提升值都为1的短字符串字段有用。否则，术语频率和长度归一化会对分数产生影响，使得术语统计的混合不再有意义。)

### cross_field and analysis
The cross_field type can only work in term-centric mode on fields that have the same analyzer. Fields with the same analyzer are grouped together as in the example above. If there are multiple groups, the query will use the best score from any group.(cross_field类型只能在具有相同分析器的字段上以术语为中心的模式工作。如上例所示，具有相同分析器的字段被分组在一起。如果有多个组，查询将使用任何组中的最佳分数。)

For instance, if we have a first and last field which have the same analyzer, plus a first.edge and last.edge which both use an edge_ngram analyzer, this query:(例如，如果我们有具有相同分析器的第一个字段和最后一个字段，加上都使用 edge_ngram 分析器的 first.edge 和 last.edge，则此查询：)
```txt
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query":      "Jon",
      "type":       "cross_fields",
      "fields":     [
        "first", "first.edge",
        "last",  "last.edge"
      ]
    }
  }
}
 # would be executed as:
     blended("jon", fields: [first, last])
     | (
         blended("j",   fields: [first.edge, last.edge])
         blended("jo",  fields: [first.edge, last.edge])
         blended("jon", fields: [first.edge, last.edge])
     )
```

In other words, first and last would be grouped together and treated as a single field, and first.edge and last.edge would be grouped together and treated as a single field.

Having multiple groups is fine, but when combined with operator or minimum_should_match, it can suffer from the [same problem](#operator-and-minimum_should_match) as most_fields or best_fields.

You can easily rewrite this query yourself as two separate cross_fields queries combined with a dis_max query, and apply the minimum_should_match parameter to just one of them:
```txt
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "dis_max": {
      "queries": [
        {
          "multi_match" : {
            "query":      "Will Smith",
            "type":       "cross_fields",
            "fields":     [ "first", "last" ],
            "minimum_should_match": "50%" # Either will or smith must be present in either of the first or last fields
          }
        },
        {
          "multi_match" : {
            "query":      "Will Smith",
            "type":       "cross_fields",
            "fields":     [ "*.edge" ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can force all fields into the same group by specifying the analyzer parameter in the query.
```txt
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
   "multi_match" : {
      "query":      "Jon",
      "type":       "cross_fields",
      "analyzer":   "standard",  # Use the standard analyzer for all fields.
      "fields":     [ "first", "last", "*.edge" ]
    }
  }
}
# which will be executed as:
blended("will",  fields: [first, first.edge, last.edge, last])
blended("smith", fields: [first, first.edge, last.edge, last])
```

### tie_breaker
By default, each per-term blended query will use the best score returned by any field in a group. Then when combining scores across groups, the query uses the best score from any group. The tie_breaker parameter can change the behavior for both of these steps:(默认情况下，每个术语混合查询将使用组中任何字段返回的最佳分数。然后，当跨组组合分数时，查询会使用任何组中的最佳分数。tie_breaker参数可以更改这两个步骤的行为：)
+ 0.0
  - Take the single best score out of (eg) first_name:will and last_name:will (default)(从（例如）first_name:will和last_name:would（默认）中取最佳分数)
+ 1.0
  - Add together the scores for (eg) first_name:will and last_name:will (将（例如）first_name:will和last_name:would的分数相加)
+ 0.0 < n < 1.0
  - Take the single best score plus tie_breaker multiplied by each of the scores from other matching fields/ groups  (取单个最佳分数加上决胜局分数乘以其他匹配字段/组的每个分数)

### bool_prefix
The bool_prefix type’s scoring behaves like [most_fields](#most_fields), but using a [match_bool_prefix query](./001.Match%20boolean%20prefix%20query.md) instead of a match query.(bool_prefix 类型的评分行为类似于 most_fields，但使用 match_bool_prefix 查询而不是 match 查询。)
```txt
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query":      "quick brown f",
      "type":       "bool_prefix",
      "fields":     [ "subject", "message" ]
    }
  }
}
```
