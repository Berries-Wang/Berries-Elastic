# Cluster-level shard allocation settings
You can use the following settings to control shard allocation and recovery:

## cluster.routing.allocation.enable
Enable or disable allocation for specific kinds of shards:
- all - (default) Allows shard allocation for all kinds of shards.
- primaries - Allows shard allocation only for primary shards.
- new_primaries - Allows shard allocation only for primary shards for new indices.
- none - No shard allocations of any kind are allowed for any indices.

This setting only affects future allocations, and does not re-allocate or un-allocate currently allocated shards. It also does not affect the recovery of local primary shards when restarting a node. A restarted node that has a copy of an unassigned primary shard will recover that primary immediately, assuming that its allocation id matches one of the active allocation ids in the cluster state.(此设置仅影响未来的分配，不会重新分配或取消分配当前已分配的分片。它也不会影响重新启动节点时本地主分片的恢复。重新启动的节点如果拥有未分配主分片的副本，则会立即恢复该主分片，前提是其分配 ID 与集群状态中的某个活动分配 ID 匹配。)

## cluster.routing.allocation.same_shard.host <sub>同一个服务器部署多个ES</sub>
If true, forbids multiple copies of a shard from being allocated to distinct nodes on the same host, i.e. which have the same network address. Defaults to false, meaning that copies of a shard may sometimes be allocated to nodes on the same host. This setting is only relevant if you run multiple nodes on each host.(如果为 true，则禁止将分片的多个副本分配到同一主机上的不同节点（即具有相同网络地址的节点）。默认为 false，这意味着有时可能会将分片的副本分配到同一主机上的节点。此设置仅在您在每个主机上运行多个节点时才有意义。)
