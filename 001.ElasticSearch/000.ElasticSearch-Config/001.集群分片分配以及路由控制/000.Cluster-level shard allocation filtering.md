# Cluster-level shard allocation filtering <sup>集群分片分配控制:例如下线节点</sup>
You can use cluster-level shard allocation filters to control where Elasticsearch allocates shards from any index. These cluster wide filters are applied in conjunction with per-index allocation filtering and allocation awareness.(您可以使用集群级分片分配过滤器来控制 Elasticsearch 从任何索引分配分片的位置。这些集群范围的过滤器与每个索引的分配过滤和分配感知结合使用。)

Shard allocation filters can be based on custom node attributes or the built-in _name, _host_ip, _publish_ip, _ip, _host, _id and _tier attributes.

The cluster.routing.allocation settings are dynamic, enabling live indices to be moved from one set of nodes to another. Shards are only relocated if it is possible to do so without breaking another routing constraint, such as never allocating a primary and replica shard on the same node.(cluster.routing.allocation 设置是动态的，可以将实时索引从一组节点移动到另一组节点。只有在不破坏其他路由约束（例如，绝不在同一节点上分配主分片和副本分片）的情况下，才会重新定位分片。)

The most common use case for cluster-level shard allocation filtering is when you want to decommission a node. To move shards off of a node prior to shutting it down, you could create a filter that excludes the node by its IP address:(集群级分片分配过滤最常见的用例是您想要停用某个节点。要在关闭节点之前将分片移出该节点，您可以创建一个过滤器，通过其 IP 地址排除该节点：)
```json
   PUT _cluster/settings
   {
     "persistent" : {
       "cluster.routing.allocation.exclude._ip" : "10.0.0.1"
     }
   }
```

## Cluster routing settings
+ cluster.routing.allocation.include.{attribute}
  - Allocate shards to a node whose {attribute} has at least one of the comma-separated values.

+ cluster.routing.allocation.require.{attribute}
  - Only allocate shards to a node whose {attribute} has all of the comma-separated values.

+ cluster.routing.allocation.exclude.{attribute}
  - Do not allocate shards to a node whose {attribute} has any of the comma-separated values.

### The cluster allocation settings support the following built-in attributes:
1. _name
   - Match nodes by node name

2. _host_ip
   - Match nodes by host IP address (IP associated with hostname)

3. _publish_ip
   - Match nodes by publish IP address

4. _ip
   - Match either _host_ip or _publish_ip

5. _host
   - Match nodes by hostname

6. _id
   - Match nodes by node id

7. _tier
   - Match nodes by the node’s data tier role
