# Shard rebalancing settings
A cluster is balanced when it has an equal number of shards on each node, with all nodes needing equal resources, without having a concentration of shards from any index on any node. Elasticsearch runs an automatic process called rebalancing which moves shards between the nodes in your cluster to improve its balance. Rebalancing obeys all other shard allocation rules such as allocation filtering and forced awareness which may prevent it from completely balancing the cluster. In that case, rebalancing strives to achieve the most balanced cluster possible within the rules you have configured. If you are using data tiers then Elasticsearch automatically applies allocation filtering rules to place each shard within the appropriate tier. These rules mean that the balancer works independently within each tier.(如果集群在每个节点上具有相同数量的分片，且所有节点都需要相同的资源，而任何索引的分片不会集中在某个节点上，则该集群是平衡的。Elasticsearch 会运行一个称为重新平衡的自动过程，该过程会在集群中的节点之间移动分片以提高其平衡性。重新平衡遵循所有其他分片分配规则，例如分配过滤和强制感知，这些规则可能会阻止其完全平衡集群。在这种情况下，重新平衡会努力在您配置的规则范围内实现最平衡的集群。如果您使用数据层，则 Elasticsearch 会自动应用分配过滤规则将每个分片放置在适当的层内。这些规则意味着平衡器在每个层内独立工作。)

You can use the following settings to control the rebalancing of shards across<sup>穿过</sup> the cluster:(您可以使用以下设置来控制整个集群中分片的重新平衡：)

## cluster.routing.allocation.allow_rebalance
Specify when shard rebalancing is allowed:
- always - (default) Always allow rebalancing.
- indices_primaries_active - Only when all primaries in the cluster are allocated.
- indices_all_active - Only when all shards (primaries and replicas) in the cluster are allocated.

## cluster.routing.rebalance.enable
Enable or disable rebalancing for specific kinds of shards:
- all - (default) Allows shard balancing for all kinds of shards.
- primaries - Allows shard balancing only for primary shards.
- replicas - Allows shard balancing only for replica shards.
- none - No shard balancing of any kind are allowed for any indices.

Rebalancing is important to ensure the cluster returns to a healthy and fully resilient state after a disruption. If you adjust this setting, remember to set it back to all as soon as possible.(重新平衡对于确保集群在中断后恢复到健康且完全有弹性的状态非常重要。如果您调整此设置，请记住尽快将其恢复为全部。)
