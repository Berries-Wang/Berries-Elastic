# Merge
A shard in Elasticsearch is a Lucene index, and a Lucene index is broken down into segments. Segments are internal storage elements in the index where the index data is stored, and are immutable. Smaller segments are periodically merged into larger segments to keep the index size at bay and to expunge deletes.(Elasticsearch 中的分片是 Lucene 索引，而 Lucene 索引又被分解为多个段。段是索引中的内部存储元素，用于存储索引数据，并且是不可变的。较小的段会定期合并到较大的段中，以控制索引大小并清除删除的内容。)

The merge process uses auto-throttling to balance the use of hardware resources between merging and other activities like search.(合并过程使用自动节流来平衡合并和搜索等其他活动之间的硬件资源的使用。)

## Merge scheduling
The merge scheduler (ConcurrentMergeScheduler) controls the execution of merge operations when they are needed. Merges run in separate threads, and when the maximum number of threads is reached, further merges will wait until a merge thread becomes available.(合并调度程序 (ConcurrentMergeScheduler) 控制合并操作的执行（在需要时）。合并在单独的线程中运行，当达到最大线程数时，进一步的合并将等待，直到合并线程可用。)

The merge scheduler supports the following dynamic setting:
1. index.merge.scheduler.max_thread_count 
   - The maximum number of threads on a single shard that may be merging at once. Defaults to Math.max(1, Math.min(4, <<node.processors, node.processors>> / 2)) which works well for a good solid-state-disk (SSD). If your index is on spinning platter drives instead, decrease this to 1.
